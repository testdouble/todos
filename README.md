# JavaScript To-Do App Face-Off

In the last few years, several JavaScript application frameworks have emerged, all competing to be the
tool-of-choice for building To-Do applications on the web. This is a contest to implement a to-do application
with the **application framework of your choice**, and then compare and contrast your results with those of
other forks of the repo.

## Instructions

0. Go play with a [working example](http://testdouble.github.com/todos/) of this Todo application.

1. Pick an app framework to use. Here are some frameworks you might try to implement this in:

  * [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone)
  * [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)
  * [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
  * [batman.js](http://batmanjs.org/)
  * [spine.js](http://spinejs.com/)
  * [angular.js](http://angularjs.org/#/)
  * [JavaScriptMVC](http://javascriptmvc.com/)

2. Load the JavaScripts you'll need in `index.html`

3. (This step's important) Write the app!

    You'll notice that client-side HTML templates are provided in `<script>` tags in `index.html`. To
    get at the default HTML template for the main application view, you might do this with jQuery:

    ``` javascript
    $('#item-template').html();
    ```

    From that point, most JavaScript app frameworks have a facility or convention for applying client-side templates.

4. Make the specs pass

    There are several Jasmine specs included (you'll probably notice the runner output on the bottom of the page).
    Prove your implementation is the greatest by making them go green! You can find the specs in `spec/todos-spec.js`

    At the top of the spec file, there's a `window.todoAppDriver` object which defines a few methods for interacting with
    the application. These methods work great with Jérôme's backbone.js example, but your mileage may vary. Feel free
    to override those methods as necessary so that the specs know how to create, read, update, and delete to-dos in
    your version of the app.

5. Compare your results!

    With the benefit of hindsight, check out how others implemented their applications by
    pulling down [other forks](https://github.com/testdouble/todos/network) of this repo.
